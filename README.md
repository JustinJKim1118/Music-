# Music-
Music: the art of using vocals and(or) instrumental sounds to create harmonies while expressing emotion
# Guitar 
The guitar is an instrument I have been playing for around 2-3 years now. I don't know much of the fundamentals and I basically learned a few chords from the start. I excelled my learning experiences by watching covers on youtube and replicating my playing to theirs. So, I learned a lot of rock music, folk music, and worship music. Over the years, it's been challenging to play the guitar, but I think that's what made this instrument so much fun to learn. Right now, i'm really into playing anime music or rock style anime music. It's a lot harder than music I have played before, but I really enjoy taking the time to learn scales and solos for these songs.

# Drums
The drums is an instrument that I have also been playing for 2-3 years. I've learned a lot since my starting point, and I'm looking forward to doing more. I play the same music styles as with guitar and I am able to keep beat really well. Rock is really my jam right now, especially anime OST's and EST's. There's something about the rhythm and tone of the drums that when played together create an awesome instrument. People who play the drums stand out in the band and really drive how the song will turn out in the end.
